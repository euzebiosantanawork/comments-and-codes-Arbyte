CSS has a historical library of commands. Some
companies and devs create some standards to facilitate the
development of certain types of pages and components.
Structures are the requirements

BUT WHAT IS A FRAMEWORK?
 
  It is an abstraction that joins common codigs between several projects of
software providing generic functionality.
  And a base structure, a development platform, as a
kind of framework. it contains tools, guides, themes
and components that streamline the development process
of solutions.
The big challenge is the business solution, not the technical solution.
 
FRAMEWOEKS MVC: Laravel, Spring, Django, Rails
 // What is MVC?
    -Model view Controller
    -Software Architectural Desing Paattern
    -One of the most frequently used patterns
    -Separates application functionality
    -Promotes organized programming
    Some Web frameworks That Use MVC Concepts
    -Ruby on Rails (Ruby)
    -Sinatra(Ruby)
    -Zend(PHP)
    -Express(JS)
    -Backbone(JS)
    -Angular (JS)
    -Django (Python)
    -Flask (Python)
 
    MODEL
    -Gata related logic
    -INteraction with database (SELECT, INSERT< UPDATE, DELETE)
    -Communicates with controller
    -Can sometimes update the view (Depends on framework)
 
    VIEW
    -What the end user sees (UI)
    -Usually consists of HTML/CSS
    -Communicates with the controller
    -Can be passed dynamic values from the controller
    Template Engines
 
    CONTROLLER
    -Receives input (from view, url)
    -Processes requests (GET,POST,PUT, DELETE)
    -Gets data from the model
    -Passes data to the view

APPLIED TO CSS
The idea of the CSS framework is that you follow a standard
development without creating "new classes" in CSS but
just specialize some styles for things that are
application (with colors and sizes).
EXAMPLE: And if our menu code was already, ready
it was only necessary to import the CSS and create an item
<ul> with the class "navbar"?
FRAMEWORK CSS - COST / BENEFIT
PROS:
-standards development
-reusable knowledge in another project
that uses the same framework
-Apps and websites look like the framework (which can
match user platform)
- you don't need a CSS expert to make some screens
(creates cost benefit that can be worthwhile in the world of
development)
- Earn updates on a recurring basis

AGAINST:
- Difficult to change the framework after
the project is already a few years old (tying the project up)
-Not every CSS framework is ripe for new
front-end technologies (React, Angular, etc.)
-All sites and applications look the same, and
it pisses you off over time
 
Most popular CSS FRAMEWORKS: Bootstrap, Foudation,
Pure CSS, Semantic UI, Materialize, Bulma, Uikit, Skeleton
BOOTSTRAP
Created by Twitter Inc., bootstrap, and undoubtedly the leader of
all front-end frameworks available on the market.
 
PROS:
- Rapid prototyping. Speaker system leaves the factory
working if the right classes are applied, leaving
the responsive page.
- Largest ecosystem of all frameworks
- Maintained by Twitter
-Has basically all the components that you will use
in a common product
 
CONS:
- Ux monotony - because it is the most popular framework, all
the pages look more or less the same face.
- Little Flexibility - Getting out of line is very difficult
- Heavy (~ 270KB out-of-the-box)
MATERIALIZE
Materializes and a modern framework based on Material
Design by Google. The framework is free, but the team
responsible for the project also offers more complete themes
that can be purchased for a very reasonable price.
 
PROS:
-Follow the Bootstrap 12-speaker system
-allows a clean starting look, taking advantage of
Google components
- Device-agnostic (runs well on mobile, desktop, etc.)
- It basically has all the components that you will use
in a common product
 
CONS:
- Little flexibility - Getting out of line and very difficult - Framework
"opinionated"
- Heavy (270KB start)
- Does not support Flexbox (a more robust alternative for
  the 12-speaker system)

FONDATION
  Foudation is a framework that calls itself "the framework
  most advanced front-end response in the world. "Usually
  adopted as a car full of developers instead the
  Bootstrp, and less opinionated and maintained by ZURP.
